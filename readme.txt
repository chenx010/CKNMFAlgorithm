Introduction:

This is a combination kernel based non-negative matrix factorization algorithm applied to face recognition.
It contains comparisons with other algorithms.

use examples by 3 steps:

step1: run main_test.m   % This is the main test file used to record the classification results of each algorithm
step2: run Plot_acc.m      % Visualize classification results
step3: run Plot_data.m    % Visualize CMC
