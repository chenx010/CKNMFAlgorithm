# CKNMFAlgorithm
Introduction:

This is a combination kernel based non-negative matrix factorization algorithm applied to face recognition.
It contains comparisons with other algorithms.We run it on Matlab R2019a.

use examples by 3 steps:

step1: run maintest.m   % This is the main test file used to record the classification results of each algorithm

step2: run Plotacc.m      % Visualize classification results

step3: run Plotdata.m    % Visualize CMC
